# HR_Equal_Stacks
Initialize project HR - Equal Stacks

This program is a solution for HackerRank problem Equal Stacks.

The first line contains three space-separated integers, n1, n2, and n3,
describing the respective number of cylinders in stacks ,1 ,2 and 3.
The subsequent lines describe the respective heights of each
cylinder in a stack from top to bottom:

The second line contains n1 space-separated integers describing the
    cylinder heights in stack 1.
The third line contains n2 space-separated integers describing the
    cylinder heights in stack 2.
The fourth line contains n3 space-separated integers describing the
    cylinder heights in stack 3.

Print a single integer denoting the maximum height at which all stacks
will be of equal height.
